"Some blogs are highly customized using themes and plugins, which can "

"solutions for automatically marking which content is important, like "
"Microdata, Microformats and Open Graph, but if you cannot or do not want to "
"use them you should provide CSS selectors so the Send to Kindle Button knows "

"Metadata is literally data that describes other data. This refers to things "
"like what your content is called, who wrote it, and when. This is important "
"because it is how your readers will organize content after it arrives on "
"their Kindle. The hardest piece of metadata to parse is typically the "
"publication date, because browsers can sometimes be picky about what they "
"accept. You should prefer to use dates in ISO-8601 format, i.e. 2013-01-15."

"selectors can be used to exclude everything that is not content. Finally, if "
"your content is spread over multiple pages, use the Pagination selector to "
"point to the \"next page\" link."
