msgid "This plugin allows an Admin to change the author slug (a.k.a. - nicename), without having to actually enter the database. You can also change the Author Base (the '/author/' portion of the author URLs). Two new fields will be added to your Dashboard. The \"Edit Author Slug\" field can be found under Users &gt; Your Profile or Users &gt; Authors &amp; Users (Users &gt; Users in WP 3.0). The \"Author Base\" field can be found under Settings &gt; Edit Author Slug. This allows you to craft the perfect URL structure for you Author pages. For your convenience, an Author Slug column is added to make it easier to determine if one needs to change the Author Slug."
