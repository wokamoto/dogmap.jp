Allows an admin (or capable user) to edit the author slug of a user, and change the author base.

== Description ==

This plugin allows full control of your user permalinks, allowing you to change both the author base (the '/author/' portion of the author URLs), and the author slug (defaults to the username of the author). You can set the author base globally, or you can set it to be user-specific based on a user's role. You now have the power to craft the perfect URL structure for you Author pages.

WordPress default structure *http://example.com/author/username/*.

Edit Author Slug allows for *http://example.com/ninja/master-ninja/*.

Using a role-based author base would allow for *http://example.com/ida/master-splinter/* (for an Administrator Role), or *http://example.com/koga/leonardo/* (for a Subscriber Role).

Development of this plugin takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/thebrandonallen/edit-author-slug/ "Edit Author Slug on Github"). Pull requests are always welcome!

Translations should be submitted to [Translate WordPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/edit-author-slug).

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Users > Your Profile, or Users > All Users > (username), and edit the author slug.
4. Click "Update Profile" or "Update User"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I edit my Author Slug? =

Make sure you are an admin, or have been assigned the `edit_users` capability.

= Why isn't my new Author Slug working? =

While I've made every attempt to prevent this, I may have missed a spot or two. First things first, go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes." You don't need to actually need to make any changes for this to work. Hopefully, this should kick your new Author Slug into gear.

If this doesn't work, make sure you don't have any slug conflicts from other posts/pages/plugins/permalink setting/etc. If you're still experiencing the issue, feel free to post a support request in the forums.

== Changelog ==
